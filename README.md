This is a simple To-Do List app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (CRUD operations). It allows users to **add, delete, edit**, and **pin tasks to the top** of the list.

The **HTML** is used to structure the elements required in the project. **CSS** is applied to style the components and create a clean, user-friendly interface. **JavaScript** handles the core logic such as task manipulation and user interactions.

Initially, the interface displays an input box at the center of the screen along with an **"Add"** button. Users can type their task into the input box and click the button to add it to the list.

Once tasks are added, each task item displays multiple action buttons like **Delete**, **Edit**, and **Pin**, which perform their respective functions.

You can also mark tasks as completed by ticking the **checkbox** located to the left of each task.
